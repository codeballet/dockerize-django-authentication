I would like to acknowledge the University of the Arts London for granting me a full-time Research Studentship within the Fashion, the Body & Material Cultures Research Centre, without which I would not have been able to conduct my research to the level of concentration and dedication that the chosen topic seemed to demand of me. Also, I want to thank my supervisors Helen Thomas and Donatella Barbieri for the consistent support and enthusiastic encouragement they have offered, through the various states of exhilaration and despair that I have experienced while writing the thesis. Lastly, I would like to express my love to those amazing people who in vain tried to share their lives with me during the years I was conducting this research, and who struggled to fully comprehend the necessity and extent to which I had to engage with my subject.
