Examples from this field include the work by the performance artist Stelarc (2008), the dance/installation artist and scholar Sarah Rubidge (2000; 2002; 2003), the dancer and choreographer Robert Wechsler (1997a; 1997b; 1998; 2009), and the choreographer and scholar Johannes Birringer (2009), who in a recently published work discusses numerous examples of performances that engage at different levels with technology and science (2008).
Given my own background as choreographer and dancer, the thesis started out as a choreographic inquiry related to my research question, aiming to address the key concepts of the thesis - which are the virtual, the abstract, and the performative - in choreographic practice. I initially projected the research project as a collaboration, combining the resources offered by the University of the Arts London, in the form of the Research Centre for Fashion the Body and Material Cultures, the Postgraduate Diploma Character Animation Course at Central Saint Martins, the MA Costume Design for Performance at London College of Fashion, together with my own practice as a choreographer, primarily rooted in the tradition of European dance theatre. The main objective of that collaboration was to develop a work which practically would explore body/technology relationships through costume design, computer animation, and aesthetic embodiment.
However, as I was researching the field of interactive practices, I discovered that there was already in place a body of work and choreographic practices with a sophisticated level of complexity in terms of body/technology interaction, as I will exemplified below through the work of Stelarc (2008), Rubidge (2003), Wechsler (2009), and Birringer (2009). During my initial research I also became increasingly aware of the crucial importance of perception in relation to practices aiming to generate a body/technology interaction. Visiting interactive interactive workshops, for instance conducted at the Brunel University in London, and at the Ishiguro laboratory in Osaka, Japan, I found that just because I was inserted in an environment where sensors were reading and giving me feedback to my movements, and machines responded to my actions, I did not necessarily perceive, or experience myself as being interactively engaged in the process.
